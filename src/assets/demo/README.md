If an image is not found, the modal will display a placeholder text "Screenshot will appear here" - so you can test the modal functionality before adding the screenshots.

## Tips

1. **High Quality:** Use good resolution screenshots (at least 800px wide)
2. **Crop Appropriately:** Remove browser chrome, focus on the actual content
3. **Privacy:** Blur or anonymize any sensitive user information
4. **Lighting:** Make sure screenshots are clear and readable

Once you add these files, the demo modal will automatically display them!
