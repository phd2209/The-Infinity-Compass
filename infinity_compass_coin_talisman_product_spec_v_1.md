# Infinity Compass – Coin Talisman System (v1)

> **Goal:** Define a thin, small, continuously wearable numerology talisman that works identically across necklace and phone use via flawless adapter design.

---

## 1. Core Product Definition

**Product Name (working):** Infinity Compass Coin Talisman  
**Core Principle:** One talisman. Multiple ways to carry it.

The *coin* is the product. Chain, phone mount, keyring, etc. are adapters.

---

## 2. Physical Dimensions (Locked – Ultra‑Minimal, Always‑On)

These dimensions prioritize continuous wear (sleep, phone, daily life) and unisex minimalism.

### Coin Dimensions

| Attribute | Specification | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Diameter | **15 mm** | Discreet, modern, phone‑first, unisex |
| Thickness (total) | **2.6 mm** | Sleep‑safe + phone‑flat |
| Stone thickness | **1.8 mm** | Structural integrity at small scale |
| Bezel thickness (front) | **0.4 mm** | Visual frame without bulk |
| Bezel thickness (back) | **0.4 mm** | Fully flush back |
| Edge radius | **0.5 mm chamfer** | Comfort, no snagging |

> Result: Coin disappears on skin and does not interfere with phone placement.

## 3. Stone Construction

### Stone Format
- **Shape:** Precision-cut flat disc (not faceted)
- **Finish:** Satin-polished (not glossy, not raw)
- **Edges:** Micro-beveled to avoid chipping

### Why Not Raw/Tumbled?
- Raw stones fail phone flatness
- Tumbled stones rotate and snag
- Flat disc allows **continuous wear** and **adapter compatibility**

Spiritual value comes from **material + intention**, not roughness.
